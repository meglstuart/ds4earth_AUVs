## Meg's To Do
- [ ] Contact Harvey Seim - may not be necessary now that we have found flight data
- [ ] Investigate Roy Ying Hae's research

## Reading list
- [Coordinate Control, Motion Optimization and Sea Experiment of a Fleet of Petrel-II Gliders](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s10033-018-0210-0): Trying to accurately reach waypoints in "hybrid" gliders. idk what that is, but it has measurements of waypoint error that might be a good thing for us to compare to?

- [Time Series Prediction Methods for Depth-Averaged Current Velocities of Underwater Gliders](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7888971): Looks like what we're trying to do actually, but seems like a bit of a basic analysis. We can at least compare our results to theirs.

-[Advanced Control in Marine Mechatronic Systems: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7835733)

- [Glider CT: Analysis and Experimental Validation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55879-8_20) Written by some of the same people. Get depth varying measurements of water velocity from drift in glider path. A possible application?
